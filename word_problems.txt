#### Scenario Based ####

!ShotGaugeDiameter
The size of a shotgun bore is measured in \textit{gauges}. The gauge number represents the number of lead balls that can be made with a pound of lead, where the diameter of the lead ball measures the bore size. For example, an 8-gauge shotgun has a bore that fits a lead ball that weighs 1/8 lb. Given that the density of lead is approximately 0.41 lb/in$^3$, what is the bore diameter of a @-gauge shotgun?
